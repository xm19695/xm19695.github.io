<h3> Portfolio </h3>

<h3> Week 1 - Site Production </h3>

<p> The first weeks homework was to create a multi-page site hosted through github. Divided into a project and homework pages. </p>



<h3> Week 2 - Embedding </h3>

<!--Chart 1 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart1">
    <script>
      var myChart1 = "Firstchart.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart1', myChart1);
    </script>
</div>

<p></p>

<!--Chart 2 -->
<div class="chart" id="chart2">
    <script>
      var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart2', myChart2);
    </script>
</div>

<p></p>

<!--Chart 3 Crypto -->
<div class="chart" id="chartCrypto">
    <script>
      var myChartCrypto = "CryptoGraph3.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chartCrypto', myChartCrypto);
    </script>
</div>

<p> The three charts for week 2 have been sourced from Rapid Charts. They show covid cases in the UK by region, UK productivity from 1971-2021 and finally, the long-run value of bitcoin from 2016-2021.  </p>

<h3> Week 3 - Hosting Data </h3>

<!--API Chart Cardiff vs Bristol vs Exeter-->
<div class="chart" id="chartcovidcities">
    <script>
      var myChartcovidcities = "CovidrateCities.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chartcovidcities', myChartcovidcities);
    </script>
</div>

<p> This chart tracks live Covid cases in Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff. Using a UK government API to automatically update the data. </p>

<!--comparison graph for week 3-->
<div class="chart" id="chartcovidcities2">
    <script>
      var mychartcovidcities2 = "CovidrateCities2.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chartcovidcities2', mychartcovidcities2);
    </script>
</div>

<p> This chart shows Covid cases in alternate cities in the South West and Wales to the previous graph.However, the data used is from a raw file hosted on GitHub resulting in it not autoupdating.</p>

<h3> Week 4 - Editing Data </h3>

<div class="chart" id="chart1week4">
  <script>
    var mychartsportsweek4 = "week4chart1.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart1week4', mychartsportsweek4);
  </script>
</div>

<p> The data for the chart above is sourced from the ONS before being manually inputted to a json instead of being imported through a URL. Sporting services and recreation from 2005 to 2019 in the UK take an amount of annual household spending, which is identified in the chart above. It portrays a clear increase in spending following the London Olympics of 2012. </p>

<div class="chart" id="chart3week4">
  <script>
    var mychart3sportsweek4 = "week4chart3.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart3week4', mychart3sportsweek4);
  </script>
</div>

<p> The average participation in physical activity in the EU by level of educational attainment. The data is sourced from Eurostat data although I have used this to create an average level of participation across all EU countries.</p>


<h3> Week 5 - API Driven Charts </h3>

<h3> Week 6 - API Fetch </h3>

<h3> Week 7 - Scraper </h3>

<h3> Week 8 - Data Stories (Economics Observatory Festival) </h3>
<!--WEEK 8 CHART EDUCATION conference -->
<div class="chart" id="chartAlevel">
    <script>
      var mychartAlevel = "week8gendergap.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chartAlevel', mychartAlevel);
    </script>
</div>

<p>At the Economic observatory conference a panelist stated that one of the effects of the pandemic was the gender gap within A-Level results had increased. This graph above compares the number A* grades between boys and girls from 2018 to 2021. Having completed this graph it shows an increased gap in results supporting the panelists argument. </p>
