  <h3> Project </h3>

<h3> Aims </h3>
<p> The key aim of this project is to delve into the relationship between GDP and its affect on life expectancy. To observe whether regions of increased wealth have significant results in longer life-expectancy. This can be an effective study with a stagnation of increases in life expectency encountered in recent years. The visualisations used within this project are a collective combination of scatter plots. Bar and line charts. With the aim to challenge any conventional standpoint that economies should always target the greatest possible levels of GDP.</p>

<h3> Data </h3>
<p> A variety of sources were used to formulate the data for this project. Excel allowing the data to be cleaned and merged. The regional data on life expectancy and GDP was downloaded directly from the ONS. The international data on life expectancy was downloaded directly from worldometres.Lastly, the data on the Gross National Income was downloaded using the World Bank API. </p>

<h3> Life Expectancy and GDP in regions of the UK </h3>

<!--GRAPH 1 of project will be gender life expectancy in the UK-->

<div class="chart" id="chart1projectLE">
    <script>
      var mychart1projectLE = "lifeexpectancyEngland.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart1projectLE', mychart1projectLE);
    </script>
</div>

<P> This first graph shows the difference in life expectancies across England and Wales. Highlighting a slight difference approximating to people from England having a greater life duration by 1 year.</P>

<p> The visualisation below shows UK GDP over time through an ONS API meaning the data is active and will have live updates. GDP is measured in millions of pounds and is adjusted for changes in price. When identifying GDP movements over the last decade it is clear there was an increase up until 2019 before GDP then falls, with a clear attribution to the global pandemic.</p>

<!--Project chart 2-->
<div class="chart" id="chart2projectGDP">
    <script>
      var mychart2projectGDP = "projectchart2GDP.json";
      vegaEmbed('#chart2projectGDP', mychart2projectGDP);
    </script>
</div>

<h3> Regression of GDP on Life Expectancy in UK regions </h3>

<p> </p>

<h3> Countries with the highest GDP per capita Vs Countries with the longest life expectancy rate</h3>

<p> These bar charts show the top 30 countries in the world for life expectancy and GDP per capita. Evidently there are significant distinctions between the charts. You can hover your mouse over the bars to see each countries data.</p>

<!--Project chart 5-->
<div class="chart" id="chart5projectcountriesGDP">
  <script>
    var mychart5projectcountriesGDP = "projectchart5GDPcountries.json";
    vegaEmbed('#chart5projectcountriesGDP', mychart5projectcountriesGDP);
  </script>
